Should you rebuild an index? Create a new one? Reboot the  server? Why is this query so slow?!? Figuring out performance problems can sometimes feel like fumbling your way through a dark room. Maybe you’ll get lucky and find the right solution?or maybe you’ll stub your toe. Either way, it’s a slow, potentially painful process. Yet finding the root causeof most performance issues is a simple exercise, once you understand where to look and when. In this full day seminar, you will learn a proven methodology that can be used to approach virtually any performance problem. Created and refined by Adam Machanic over several years, this strategy leverages core SQL Server performance tools (including dynamic management views, Extended Events, and WMI counters), applying them to various performance troubleshooting techniques (such as waits and queues analysis, baselining, and real-time activity monitoring). Each of these tools and techniques has a unique role, and you will learn to use them cooperatively toquickly and adaptively find the actual cause of performance issues. All of this will be illustrated through complete demonstrations that will teachyou how to drill from high-level problem detection all the way to specific spot in a query plan or deeper?pinpointing the exact problem and helpingyou to quickly solve it.

Lenni will pull no punches as he rips through the most important SQL Server programmability points in this intensive demo-packed tour.\n\nPart 1—T-SQL Features. We’ll start with a quick introduction to SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT), the brand new database development environment for SQL Server in Visual Studio, and then dive into the many enhancements made to T-SQL. Learn how to usetable-valued parameters to marshal entire sets of rows across the networkfrom client to server, and to pass them between your stored procedures and UDFs. Find out about MERGE, a powerful DML statement that combines thecapabilities of four (or more) separate operations, and INSERT OVER DML, which enhances your ability to capture change data from the OUTPUT clause of any DML statement. Work with the latest date and time data types, which include support for time zone awareness. Then learn about the newest T-SQL enhancements in SQL Server 2012, such as windowing (OVER clause) enhancements, running and sliding aggregates, 22 new functions, the THROW statement, server-side paging, the SEQUENCE object, and new metadata discovery techniques.\n\nPart 2—.NET Data Access. You’ll need to access your SQL Server data from .NET applications and services, and so we’ll examine the plethora of data access strategies available with the .NET Framework 4. You’ll learn the mechanics of language-integrated query (LINQ), and compare conventional ADO.NET with LINQ To SQL and the ADO.NET Entity Framework. You’ll see how these object relational mapping (ORM) technologies work, and also learn how to use WCF Data Services and WCF RIA Services to extend your data’s reach to the world.\n\nPart 3—Beyond Relational. Then we’ll examine the powerful “beyond relational” features, including the latest additions in SQL Server 2012. These features will get you thinking outside the box with respect to the types of data that can be managed by a relational database system. Learn how to use the hierarchyid data type to cast a hierarchical structure over any relational table. Dig into FILESTREAM and FileTable to discover how you can finally enjoy the native ability to storelarge binary objects in the file system transparently. We'll then move onto the geospatial data types that enable you to integrate location-intelligence into the database, and we'll build several location-aware applications on top of these data types. We’ll also cover the rich XML support provided by the relational engine, including XSD, XPath, and XQuery.\n\nPart 4—Enterprise Features. We’ll wrap up with powerfulenterprise-level data warehousing and security features including Change Data Capture, SQL Server Audit and Transparent Data Encryption. With Change Data Capture (CDC), you can monitor and record changes made to transactional tables without requiring any application changes or resorting to triggers. Enabling Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) automatically encrypts the entire database in the background, without increasing database size,and without requiring any code.

In fact, it is estimated that over 80% of the data is now so called unstructured data. SQL Server provides support to manage unstructured and semistructured data and provides rich services over such data. In this introduction, we give an overview on these capabilities and set up the reminder of the Beyond Relational journey.\n\n2.      Taking SQL Server 2012 Beyond Relational: Rich Unstructured Data Management\n\n80% or more of the data produced and stored are so called unstructured documents and are often not stored in the database, but often need to be managed in conjunction with relational data. In order to facilitate the storage and management of unstructured data, SQL Server has evolved from storing blobs to providing a sophisticated integration with the Windows Filesystem and provides rich services over such data to provide an interesting and compelling application development experience. This presentation introduces the new unstructured data processing capabilities of SQL Server 2012 that provide full Windows application-compatible file management over files stored in SQL Server as well as the services to unlock the information in such data such as the extensions and improvements to Full-Text Search and the introduction of semantic similarity search.\n\n3.      Taking SQL Server 2012 Beyond Relational into the World of Spatial DataManagement\n\nMany applications today need to be locally aware to providecustomer value. SQL Server 2012 has continued its spatial investment to address the next major customer requirements around spatial data support. Thus, this presentation will provide an overview of SQL Server’s spatial support and introduce the new spatial types, capabilities and performance enhancements such as curves and spatial aggregates.\n\n4.      Taking SQL Server 2012 Beyond Relational: Deep Dive into Spatial Performance and Spatial Indexing\n\nSpatial data operations are often expensive. Thus, in order to achieve the required performance and scalability in spatial database applications, we need to define spatial indices. This presentation describes how SQL Server 2008 and 2012 spatial indexes work and gives tips and presents the tools on how to analyze and improve your spatial application's performance even when it needs to scale to large amounts of spatial data.

Varigence tools accelerate BI development, enhance reusability, and improve agility through the use of customizable patterns and automation scripts. Define all aspects of your BIsolution in a common language using a convenient visual editor, and Varigence tools will transform your metadata into comprehensive T-SQL scripts, database schemas, SSIS packages, SSAS cubes, and documentation. You can leverage existing frameworks or implement your own, with down-to-the-metal customizability. This allows you to quickly implement and modify complete BI solutions without replicating effort in multiple projects. \n\nIn addition, we’ll take a very brief look at our Vivid add-in for Excel, which adds richer, deeper, analytical functionality to native ExcelPivotTables.

However, thereare some painful shortcomings in the toolset that make it difficult to automate package creation, easily reuse patterns and templates, create packages directly from schema information and other metadata, and work with others on the same solution.  \n\nThe free and open source BIDS Helper Add-In (http://bidshelper.codeplex.com) solves many common issues with BI development, and this is no exception.  BIDS Helper now offers support for automatically generating SSIS packages using the Business Intelligence Markup Language (Biml).  Biml is an XML-based language that allows you to describe your BI solution in a declarative fashion, similarly to using HTML to describe how a web page should appear. In addition, you can embed BimlScript (C# or VB.NET code) into Biml, in the same way that ASP.NET works with HTML. This allows for large numbers of packages to be created with a minimal amount of code.  Create the pattern or script once, and use it many times – or share it with your colleagues and the community.  Best of all, the Biml language has an open specification and can be used for free from tools like BIDS Helper.","SpeakerKey":"Varigence","Type":"Spo","Level":"100","Where":"Mancy"},{"Key":"SQLBITS1371","When":"2012-03-31T13:30:00+01:00","Title":"Memory Management for Analysis Services with SQL Sentry","Description":"SQL Server Analysis Services has a reputation as a bit of a “black box”.  While there is some degree of truth to that, as there is less visibility into what’s going on under the hoodin Analysis Services than in SQL Server, there is relevant and actionable data available.  Memory management in particular is often a challenge, in part due to the differences between SQL Server and Analysis Services.\n\nIn this session Scott Fallen, SQL Sentry Sales Engineer, will cover topics on how to monitor and tune Analysis Services to get the most out of your memory.  You will learn about counters to watch, best practices, and monitoring options.  We will also investigate how Analysis Services uses memory, and how it differs from SQL Server.\n\nThe session will wrap up by looking at making Analysis Services monitoring easier and troubleshooting faster by using SQL Sentry Performance Advisor for Analysis Services.  In this segment of the presentation, Scott will demonstrate the live and historical performance dashboards, query capture and analysis, as well as overall usage information captured by PerformanceAdvisor for Analysis Services.","SpeakerKey":"SQLSentry","Type":"Spo","Level":"100","Where":"Avize"},{"Key":"SQLBITS1313","When":"2012-03-30T13:30:00+01:00","Title":"Understand Complex Plans and Staying Sane with Plan Explorer","Description":"Plan Explorer has changed the way people tune queries and madecomplex plan analysis easier for all.
