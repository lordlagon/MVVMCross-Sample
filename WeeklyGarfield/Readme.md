Update - october 2013 - Sadly Dilbert are no longer supplying images in their feeds:

"Due to changes with our feeds, we are now making this RSS feed a link to Dilbert.com."

:(

Update - august 2017 - Converted the windows 8 app to a UWP app, updated MvvmCross references to version 5.1.1.

Linked the RSS feed to a Garfield feed and renamed the app since Dilbert RSS feed was not available.
